# puc-c-project2
This project implements the Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of patterns on a matrix based on rules of survival, birth, and death. The unique feature of this implementation is that it allows the user to define the number of generations to simulate, making the experience more interactive and controlled.
